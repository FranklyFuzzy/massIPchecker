# massIPchecker
This script uses regex to pull all the IPs out of a document and then provide unique and frequency counts. It also performs reverse lookup to identify IPs of interest.

## Project Goals
Fast IP frequency check and reverse lookup to quickly identify IPs of interest.

## Requirements/Resources
Python3

## Procedures
- Copy the python file under related documents
- Ensure you navigate to the correct directory in PS and Bash
- Call the program (python $title.py, or python3 $title.py in bash)
- Type in the name of the text file to be queried for IPs

## Current Status
Working

## To do
Possible further development of isolating specific IP for additional data gathering (enter IP and retrieve additional meta data)
